# Cloud Architecture
*Pillars of AWS Well-Architected Framework*
- Operational excellence
- Security
- Reliability
- Performance efficiency
- Cost optimization

*Operational Excellence*
- Perform operations as code and annotate documentation
- Frequently make small, reversible changes
- Anticipate failure and learn from them and operational events

*Security*
- Implement strong identity foundation and enable traceability
- Apply security to all layers and automate best practices
- Protect data in transit and at rest

*Reliability*
- Test procedures to automatically recover from failure
- Scale horizontally to increase availability of aggregate system
- Stop guessing capacity and manage change in automation

*Performance Efficiency*
- Democratize advanced technologies and go global in minutes
- Use serverless architectures
- Have mechanical sympathy and experiment often

*Cost Optimization*
- Adopt consumption model and stop spending money on data center operations
- Measure overall efficiency, analyze and attribute expenditure
- Use managed and application-level services to reduce ownership cost

*Reliability and High Availability*
- High availability is when a system can withstand some degradation while still available with minimal downtime
- Reliability is a measure of your system's ability to provide functionality when desired by the user
- Fault tolerance is the ability of an application to remain operational even when a failure occurs
- Scalability the ability of an application to accommodate increases in capacity without design changes

*AWS Trusted Advisor*
- An online tool that provides real-time guidence to help provision resources
- Gives recommendations in cost optimization, performance, security, fault tolerance, and service limits
