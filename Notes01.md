# CIT 114
## Notes 01: Cloud Concept Overview 
- There are 4 things that information technology specialists will work on by utilizing IT systems: data overload, mobile and wireless usages, cloud services, and video bandwidth.
- “...employment of computer and information technology occupations is projected to grow 12 percent from 2018 to 2028, which is faster than the average for all occupations, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics.” This quote is interesting to me because it shows just how important information technology is for many businesses and how people utilize it.
- Hardware counts as all the physical components of an IT system, such as a motherboard, CPU, RAM, hard drives, and external devices.
- Software includes all the data, programs, and code that are stored digitally in a hard drive.
- A new fact I learned is that virtual cloud hardware actually runs as software on top of specialized hardware, while still using the CPUs, RAM, and hard drives.
- The 4 pillars of an IT framework are: 
1. Infrastructure 
2. Development 
3. Security 
4. Data
- “Preventing human error and layering new tools into operations are critical. Cybersecurity professionals need to shift their mindset from preventing all attacks to detecting a breach and reacting quickly and decisively.” This quote is interesting to me because it explains how much of an important job cybersecurity is and how humans must have quick reflexes for it.
- I learned that in May 2019, the median annual wage for computer and information technology occupations was $88,240, higher than the median annual wage for all occupations of $39,810.
