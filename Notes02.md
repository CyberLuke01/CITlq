## Cloud Economics and Billing
*A Brief History*
- The idea of computing in a "cloud" originates back to utility computing, a concept that computer scientist John McCarthy publicly proposed in 1961.

*Business Drivers*
- Capacity planning: the process of determining and fulfilling future demands of an organization's IT resources, products, and services.
- Two costs need to be accounted for: new infrastructure acquisition cost, and the cost of its ongoing ownership.
- Organizational agility is the measure of an organization's ability to respond to ongoing changes.

*Concepts and Terminology*
- The term cloud refers to a distinct IT environment that is designed for remotely provisioning extensible and measured IT resources.
- An IT resource is a physical or virtual IT-related artifact that can be either software based or hardware based, such as a virual or physical server, or custom software application.
- Scaling: the ability of the IT resource to handle increased or decreased usage demands, horizontally or vertically.
- Cloud service: any kind of IT resource that is made remotely accessible via a cloud environment.

*Goals and Benefits*
- Reduced investments and proportional costs; increased scalability; and increased availability and reliability

*Risks and Challenges*
- Increased security vulnerabilities; reduced operation government control; limited portablity between cloud providers; and multi-regional regulatory and legal issues

*From Google's Perspective*
- Cloud computing is user-centric, task-centric, powerful, accessible, intelligent, and programmable

*Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)*
- IaaS is instant computing infrastructure, provisioned and managed over the Internet, and can help avoid the expense and complexity of buying and managing physical servers and other data infrastructure

*Platform as a Service (PaaS)*
- PaaS is complete development and deployment environment in the cloud, with resources that allow you to deliver everything from simple cloud-based apps to advanced, cloud-enabled enterprise applications

*Software as a Service (SaaS)*
- SaaS allows users to connect to and use cloud-based apps over the Internet, such Microsoft Office or Google Workspace

> In 2002, Amazon.com launched the Amazon Web Services (AWS) platform... It wasn't until 2006 that the term "cloud computing" emerged in the commercial arena. It was during this time that Amazon launched its Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) services...

I find it interesting how the Amazon Web Services plaform goes as far back as 2002 while the EC2 services were released 4 years later.

> Countries have laws that require some types of data to be disclosed to certain government agencies or to the subject of the data. For example, a European cloud consumer's data that is located in the U.S. can be more easily accessed by government agencies (due to the U.S. Patriot Act) when compared to data located in many European Union countries.

This quote is interesting to me due to the controversey of users' data collection in recent years, particularly in social media apps such as Tik Tok, Instragram, etc.

What factors of cloud services could change as a result of increasing AI usage?
